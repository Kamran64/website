| ```APPSODY_WATCH_DIR```        | This variable contains the watch directories to watch for changes in. There can be multple directories separated by a ';'. The format is dir1;dir2. The value of ```APPSODY_MOUNTS``` can be used in place of ```APPSODY_WATCH_DIR```.                                                                   | ```ENV APPSODY_WATCH_DIR=/project/user-app```                     |  N/A         |

| ```APPSODY_MOUNTS```           | This variable contains the mount directories, which can alternatively be used as watch directories if no value exists for  ```APPSODY_WATCH_DIR```.              There can be multiple mount directories separated by a';'. The format is :/.                                                            | ```ENV APPSODY_MOUNTS=/:/project/user-app```                      |  N/A         |
| ```APPSODY_INSTALL```          | Command which is run to do any install needed before the ```APPSODY_RUN/TEST/DEBUG``` and ```APPSODY_RUN/TEST/DEBUG>_ON_CHANGE``` commands are run. <br><br> ```ENV APPSODY_INSTALL="npm install --prefix user-app"```                                                                                   | ```ENV APPSODY_INSTALL="npm install --prefix user-app"```         |   N/A        |
| ```APPSODY_RUN```              | This is the command run for the server process after the ```APPSODY_INSTALL``` command, when the mode is 'run'. If your command involves complex environment variable expansions, it may be better to encapsulate your command into a script.                                                            | ```ENV APPSODY_RUN="npm start"```                                 |   N/A        |
| ```APPSODY_RUN_ON_CHANGE```    | This is the command run when a change is detected on the file system by the controller when the mode is 'run'. If your command involves complex environment variable expansions, it may be better to encapsulate your command into a script.

If the file watching is disabled, the value should be "". | ```ENV APPSODY_DEBUG_ON_CHANGE="npm run debug"```                 |    N/A       |
| ```APPSODY_DEBUG_KILL```       | This variable isused to signal that when the mode is "debug" the controller will kill the server process started by ```APPSODY_DEBUG``` prior to starting the watch action specified by ```APPSODY_DEBUG_ON_CHANGE```. The values supported are true or false.                                           | ```APPSODY_DEBUG_KILL=<true/false>```                             | True      |
| ```APPSODY_TEST```             | This is the command to run the test cases run after the ```APPSODY_INSTALL``` command, when the mode is 'test'. If your command involves complex environment variable expansions, it may be better to encapsulate your command into a script.                                                            | ```ENV APPSODY_TEST="npm test && npm test --prefix user-app"```   |   N/A        |
| ```APPSODY_TEST_ON_CHANGE```   | This is the command run when a change is detected on the file system by the controller when the mode is 'test'. If your command involves complex environment variable expansions, it may be better to encapsulate your command into a script. If the file watching is disabled, the value should be "".  | ```ENV APPSODY_TEST_ON_CHANGE=""```                               |  N/A         |
| ```APPSODY_TEST_KILL```        | This variable is used to signal that when the mode is "test" the controller will kill the server process started by ```APPSODY_TEST``` prior to starting the watch action specified by ```APPSODY_TEST_ON_CHANGE```. The values supported are true or false.                                             | ```APPSODY_TEST_KILL=<true/false>```                              | True      |
